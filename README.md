# Levy AR Lab

This is an unofficial visualization of Android: Netrunner set rotation and card legality.

You can find it online at [http://levyarlab.com](http://levyarlab.com).

## Getting Started

- Install with `npm install`
- Run local dev version with `npm run serve`
- Build production files with `npm run build`, then run a find and replace to change `=/` to `=./` on /dist/index.html (will eventually figure out how to fix this during build)
